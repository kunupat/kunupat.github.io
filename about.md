The Internet has a lot of information. I mean, really a lot!

Often the search begins with a search engine query resulting in tons of articles, tutorials, videos, and paid courses. So a learner often gets lost in the information cloudburst.

Videos are a fantastic medium to create learning content. Some YouTubers have been making some awesome videos to teach you various technologies. But there is one problem with YouTube videos- We can't search content within the video. We have to rely on the tags associated with the videos that helped those videos feature on top of the search results. We rely on number of views, likes, and subscribers a video has got over time. But it can't always be the right indicator of the content quality. Particularly if you are only interested in a part of the vast topic that the video might have just touched base on. Or sometimes, the content we were interested in was somewhere in the middle of the video that we just skipped. We watch the entire video tutorial to realize (often at the end) that it did not have what we were looking for.

Similarly, the official guides and third-party tutorials and articles explaining various HOW-TOs are a great way to start too. But that too has it's limitations, mainly if the content is not well structured.

Paid courses and Learning Management Systems have focused and dedicated content creators which overcome most of the issues listed above. But they are paid.

This blog is my effort to create structured content which addresses the above problems and it is free of cost. I planned to start this blog also as a learning journal of all the content I refer to while learning something new and exciting. I hope someone finds value in it.

Cheers.
